        description: >
            History buffer size. This controls how long pixels will stay
            in the history buffer, greater values lead to smoother results
            but also might produce more artifacts.

    - jitter_amount:
        type: float
        range: [0.05, 2.0]

        runtime: true
        label: Jitter Amount
        description: >
            Controls how much each pixel is jittered, higher values might
            preserve better details but also introduce flickering.

    - post_sharpen_amount:
        type: float
        range: [0.0, 3.0]
        default: 1.0
        shader_runtime: true
        label: Post Sharpen Amount
        description: >
            Sharpens the image after performing the antialiasing, to avoid a blurry look.
